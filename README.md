## PrivacyOps Automation Toolkit

A modular, open-source privacy operations dashboard that streamlines key workflows like vendor risk assessments, RoPA generation, and PIA documentation using Python, Streamlit, and SQLite. Built to demonstrate how lightweight tooling can support scalable, auditable privacy processes with minimal overhead.

## Overview

This project is a hands-on automation framework that simulates core privacy engineering functions often performed across Legal, Compliance, and Security teams. It includes:

- A dynamic dashboard built with Streamlit
- A local data layer using SQLite (no external cloud setup required)
- Workflow logic to automate common privacy documentation tasks

The goal is to make privacy risk management more programmatic, measurable, and integrated into CI/CD environments over time.

## Features

- Vendor Risk Assessment UI – Create and track assessments with status, risk score, and categories
- RoPA Auto-Generation – Dynamically generate records of processing activities with prefilled data
- PIA Documentation – Capture purpose, legal basis, and risk mitigations for processing activities
- SQLite Storage – Local persistent storage with extendable schema
- Metrics Preview – Simple dashboard-style summaries of assessment status and risk distribution

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+ – Core scripting language
- Streamlit – Fast prototyping and deployment of UI workflows
- SQLite – Lightweight embedded DB for offline-first development
- Pandas – Data wrangling and processing

## Use Cases
- Internal teams doing vendor risk triage or RoPA mapping without a full-blown GRC platform
- Privacy engineers building out automation proof-of-concepts

## Usage Examples
# Creating a Vendor Assessment
- Navigate to the "Vendor Assessment" tab
- Fill in vendor details, risk factors, and status
- Submit and track assessment progress in the dashboard
# Generating RoPA Entries
- Go to the "RoPA" tab
- Enter processing activity details, purpose, data categories, and retention
- Automatically generate a structured record to support audit and compliance

## Roadmap
- Add CSV import/export
- Jira and ServiceNow webhook integrations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- PDF generation and compliance reports
- Metabase/Redash integration for advanced analytics
